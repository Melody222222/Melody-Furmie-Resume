  <p class="row">I have years of experience within administration and customer service, having worked in many different industries and environments.<br> I want the opportunity to practice my newly aquired skills, focusing on front end development and UX design.<br>As I moved through my programming bootcamp, I learnt more about UX design which I found to be rather exciting.<br> I believe it would be a good fit for my skills and I really enjoy researching and learning more about this. <br>I am interested in learning more about how UX design collaborates with<br>programming and people's experiences on sites, the psycholoy involved in this<br>and how this all flows into delivering a complete solution to end users.<br>
  <br>I thrive in spaces where mistakes and failures are viewed as growth areas and opportunities to improve and refine my skills.<br> I approach personal development with enthusiasm, emotional intelligence and empathy are what I consider my strengths.<br> The truth, although uncomfortable at times, provides more long term practical benefits than neglecting personal improvements.<br>My favorite things to do in my spare time is hunt for cappachino's, go to the beach, watch funny movies and read.</div>
